                       Happiness is a state of mind. The dictionary definition is &quot;feelings of joy and
pleasure mingled together”. A feeling of happiness is more than just an
experience of joy or pleasure. It is a state of mind where the individual feels
that “life is good”. As Aristotle says, “happiness is the meaning and the
purpose of life, the whole aim and end of human existence.” I believe that
everyone wants to be happy in life. One is abnormal if he prefers to be sad
and alone. Happiness is something that must be practice according to John
Lubbock. Well, I guess he’s right. I know happiness will come deep within us
if only we set our minds on it. How could I promote happiness? Of course by
beginning with myself. The saying, “10 percent is what happens to us and
90 percent is how we react with it” is one of my favorite. I may not be able to
control what will happen to me, but surely, I always have the power over my
emotions. In every circumstance, whether it may be good or bad, I must
always keep those smiles plastered in my face. I must be thankful to God in
whatever things happen for I know He’s always in control of everything.
Another thing to do is for me to know my purpose in life. Since I already
knew it, and I already realized what I really wanted in life, it is important for
me to have a lot of faith in God and have self-confidence inside. Next is for
me to, share God’s love to other people… it may be through serving others.
The feeling of making other people happy is something that I would never
trade. Enjoying the company of my love ones also would bring happiness to
me. If I would make a way to get even closer to my family and friends… I bet
that would be a sure source of happiness. Mark Twain believes that whoever
is happy will make others happy, too. So if I wanted to promote happiness to

others, I must have that happiness first.

                         If you think positively about yourself, others, and the world
  around you, your words and actions will follow your thoughts.
  But too many times we lack faith in ourselves. We don’t
  believe that good things will come to us, or that we deserve
  good things to happen to us and around us. We tend to believe
  in the things that are getting in our way that are the stumbling
  blocks instead of the power within ourselves to capably
  handle life and all its surprises.

                       I often tell my clients to consider how they would treat a really
good friend. If your best friend came to you and voiced a
negative opinion about themselves, how they handled a
situation, or a future possibility they would like to see happen
in their life, etc. What would you say to them? Would you
affirm their negative traits or tell them to give up hope? More
than likely, you wouldn’t. You would encourage them. You
would affirm their character and highlight their strengths to
help build their confidence. You would probably also use
comforting words to help increase their patience, their ability
to be resilient, and to overcome the struggle. Right?
                     </p>
                     <p>
                       What makes it so difficult then to use this same strategy on
you? It often seems so much “easier “to be hypercritical of
yourself and constantly berate yourself over every mistake.
But, this constant self-judgment will lead you down the path of
sadness instead of acceptance and happiness. In the same
way you wouldn’t let a friend wallow in that negative mire,
don’t let yourself do it either! Your life is a mirror reflection of
what you believe to be true about yourself and the world
around you. Start focusing on using positive thoughts, words,
and actions today. Once you start doing this, within a very
short amount of time you will see a miraculous difference in
how you see yourself and the world around you. I know it
made such a huge difference in my own life when I stopped
always being so angry and hateful towards myself, and started
focusing on the person I really am AND how I really want to
show up in the world.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                       I want you to illuminate the beautiful positive light that is
within you and learn to harness its power to transform! You
can become a beacon of hope and happiness for yourself and
others. When you learn to reframe and transform the negative
thoughts and images that show up in your mind, it will change
your life forever. You will be able to tap into that skill every
single time they show up. You will be happier, more confident,
emotionally stable, and stronger.
